This is the source code of my personal blog on http://teumert.net, hosted via 
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

I wanted a source controlled, easily maintainable, lightwheight blog. 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) was a good choice for that, since I could
host my page on GitHub, have it source controled and could easily add new stuff
and the page would get automatically rebuilt.

See my ["About Me" page](https://teumert.net/about/) for more information about me and my blog, 
and the ["Legal Info" page](https://teumert.net/legal-info) for licensing information of my blog posts.
