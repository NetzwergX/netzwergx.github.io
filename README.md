Source Code of my blog at [teumert.net](http://teumert.net)
===========================================================

This is the source code of my personal blog on http://teumert.net, hosted via 
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

I wanted a source controlled, easily maintainable, lightwheight blog. 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) was a good choice for that, since i could
host my page on GitHub, have it source controled and could easily add new stuff
and the page would get automatically rebuilt.
