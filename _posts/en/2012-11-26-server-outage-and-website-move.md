The ongoing outage of my vServer has reminded me of the fact, that I had wanted to move some of my domains a long time ago, but never got to that.

One of the domains affected by the outage is tr3kk3r.net / tr3kk3r.de, my former domain for WCF 1.x plugin support etc.

I have been planing to move my websites and restructure them for a long time now. ‘tr3kk3r’ was a name that seemed funny when I was 14, but that was some years ago. Along with my plans to release commercial plugins when WCF 2.0 will hit, I needed to come up with something new.

However, WCF 2.0 development is moving slow and so I have not change anything yet. Until now.

Effective immediately, tr3kk3r.net will land here. Information about my new WCF 2.0 software will be released in a new category in this blog. I have not found a final solution yet for the support of my plugins. Gee, I’m not even sure about the right support mode (Ticketsystem, Support board etc.). However, there are talks going on with webmasters from other platforms within the WCF scene and I will definitely find an appropriate way to support all of my plugins.

In the meantime I will drop support for all WCF 1.x plugins. Once WCF 2.0 will be released, I will only support my WCF 2.0 plugins. Of course, all of my relevant WCF 1.x plugins will be updated or rewritten from scratch for WCF 2.0. I do already have some amazing ideas.

The other effect of this is that I will switch from server4you to some other hoster. My vServer is offline since ~8:00 a.m. and the first notification I have got is from 13:24 p.m. There is still no ETA for my vServer running normal again.

Sadly, I can’t do anything about it, since server4you only guarantees 99% uptime. While this may sound much, I can tell you, it is not. There are other important services running on that server and I am getting very frustrated not to be able to use them.
