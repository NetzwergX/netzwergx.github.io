This is the question I ask myself more often lately, seeing board discussions go sideways, parties in discussions getting mixed up in fights rather then discussions, and people constantly blaming other people for things that could be considered insignificant.
I too was that kind of guy. When someone would blame someone else for something that wasn't his fault, I'd step in, I'd set things right. Except, I know realize I wasn't. I just gave more fuel to the discussion.

The ones who know me from the *WoltLab Community* (WCom) -- and by this I mean the **old** *WCom*, the one with the Plugin-Database and the separate forum that existed alongside the *WoltLab Support Forum (WSF)*, not the *WoltLab Community Forum* that exists nowadays -- will certainly have read many those threads where i participated. I sometimes criticized the team, I sometimes criticized WoltLab, but more often, i defended them. Eventually, I was asked to join the WCom Team, which I declined.

Lately, I have been absent from the WoltLab "scene". Partially because I am more actively focusing on my education (trying to get my Bachelor of Computer science done), and partially because I more and more grew tired of all this fighting about -- yes, about what exactly? --, while waiting for WCF 2.0 to become more stable.

It is always about the same things. WoltLab is stupid. WoltLab is too slow. The mods are baddies. It is always the same stupid discussions about the same stupid things. 

But what really drove me away was the [new alpha version of WBB4](http://beta.woltlab.com). If there was always a community I did not want to be part of, this is it. If you think forums of MMOs are bad, you are mistaken. They are kindergarden in comparison. In this board, fighting, yelling and childish behavior is the normal behavior.

I did not really take an active part in that board, and then I was gone for some days to the [DEKT in HH](http://www.kirchentag.de/), and when I went to catch up what happended during those days, I got a rather discouraging resumee. Nothing new, but a hell of a lot of fights.

Going on
------------

In the past, I always respected and envied the people who created software, or put much effort in something, that stood away from those discussions and just let it be. But know i realize why. It doesn't change i single thing. Will WoltLab stop building software? No. Will I still get a great framework, even if i do not longer actively post in the various communities? Most likely. So what should I fight for. There is so much more in life.

You can do so much better software if you don't care the slightest what other people say (except for accepting some really constructive feedback on the way), and when you invest your power in creating things, rather then fighting. And there is so much outside there in the real world that you can do better when you simply don't care about random people that don't know you on the internet. 

So this is it. Will I leave the WoltLab scene completely? Hell, no! I still enjoy writing software, and I certainly will publish new commercial (and also some free, as in without fee) plugins that will be useful for many people. I simply won't take part in this so called "Community" anymore. I'm tired of it.
