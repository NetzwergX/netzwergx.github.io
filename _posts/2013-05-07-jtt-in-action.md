Apart from my very own blog, the [Jekyll Template Toolkit (JTT)](https://github.com/NetzwergX/jekyll-template-toolkit) you can see JTT in action at the following sites / being used by the following people:

*Jeremy Friesen* uses [JTT](https://github.com/NetzwergX/jekyll-template-toolkit) in his blog under the title ["Take on Rules"](http://jeremyf.github.io/). His blog shows how the [category](http://jeremyf.github.io/category/) and [tags pages](http://jeremyf.github.io/tags/) look with a multitude of entries.

*lock zhang* uses [JTT](https://github.com/NetzwergX/jekyll-template-toolkit) [in his personal blog](http://gbyukg.github.io/), where you can see the [archive widget with posts way back 'til 2011](http://gbyukg.github.io/archive.html#2013), as well as [another example for the tags page](http://gbyukg.github.io/tags.html#jekyll) and the *linear scaling tag cloud* as widget in the sidebar!

And since all good things go by three, I finally present JTT on the [personal blog of Marcos Serpa](http://marcoserpa.com/), who also happens to blog about things that I actually enjoy to read.


I hope you find these demonstrations of at least a whole bunch of the features of **JTT** useful. If you are using JTT feel free to [leave comments by filing an issue
on GitHub](https://github.com/NetzwergX/netzwergx.github.com/issues).
