Yet another blog? Yup, and some interesting stuff to read. Development announcements, interesting code 
snippets, oddities from programming languages and much more.

Since I am currently in the process of restructing my website, I have set up this blog as a central
place for everything I think is worthwhile to share. This will include lots of source code as
this is a technical blog. Things I am going to post here include:

* Release announcements
* Roadmaps
* Software Previews
* Short software architecture / design articles
* "How To's" and code snippets

It will mainly be about Java, PHP \([WCF](http://www.woltlab.com/wcf/)\), some other useful tools 
and general programming / development topics.

Be excited about great news, such as the release of JTT, the jekyll template toolkit (coming soon).


Currently, this blog does not allow for comments. But I will get some and they'll be awesome. I hope
I can blog about it soon.
