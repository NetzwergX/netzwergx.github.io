Since i am currently in the process of restructuring my website i have set up this blog as a central
place for everything i think is worthwhile to share. This will include lots of source code as
this is a technical blog. Things i will post here include:

* Release announcements
* Roadmaps
* Software Previews
* Short software architecture / design articles
* "How To?"s and code snippets

It will mainly be about Java, PHP \([WCF](http://www.woltlab.com/wcf/)\) and some other useful tools 
and general programming / development topics.

Be exited about great news, such as the release of JTT, the jekyll template toolkit (coming soon).


Currently, this blog does not have comments. But i will get some, and they'll be awesome. I hope
a can blog about it soon.
