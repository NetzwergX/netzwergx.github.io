The ongoing outage of my vServer has reminded me of the fact, that i wanted to move some of my domains a long time ago already, but i never got to it.


One of the domains affected by the outage is tr3kk3r.net / tr3kk3r.de, my old domain for WCF 1.x plugin support etc.


I planned to mov my web sites and restructure them for a long time now. ‘tr3kk3r’ was a name that was funny when i was 14, but that was so many years ago. And with my plans to release commercial plugins when WCF 2.0 hits, i as in need to come up with something new.


But WCF 2.0 development is slow, and so i did not change anything yet. Until now.


Effective immediately, tr3kk3r.net will point here. Information about my new WCF 2.0 software will be released in a new category in this blog. I have not yet found a final solution for the support of my plugins. Hell, i’m not even sure about the right support format (Ticket System, Support Board etc.). But there are talks going on with webmasters from other platforms in the WCF scene, and i will definitely find a good way to support all of my plugins.


In the meantime i will drop support for all WCF 1.x plugins. Once WCF 2.0 is out, i will only support my WCF 2.0 plugins. Of course all my relevant WCF 1.x plugins will be updated or rewritten from scratch for WCF 2.0. I do already have some amazing ideas.


The other effect of this is that i will switch from server4you to some other hoster. My vServer is offline since ~8:00 in the morning, and the first notification that i got is from 13:24. and there is still no ETA for my vServer running normal again.


Sadly, i can’t do anything about it, since server4you only guarantees 99% uptime. While this may sound much, i can tell you, it is not. There are other important services running on that server, and i am getting very frustrated not to be able to use them.
