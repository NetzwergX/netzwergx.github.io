### Jekyll & My Blog
I have not  yet really advertised my software or pushed to get it more widely spread, but ever since Kevin Holler [@iamkevinholler](https://twitter.com/iamkevinholler) mentioned my [jekyll-template-toolkit (JTT)][https://t.co/TWeXCgvW] on his [twitter account](https://twitter.com/iamkevinholler) the number of stargazers is skyrocking (well, not exactly, but i get more and more stargazer every week).

Additionally, [@danieldriver](https://github.com/danieldriver/) based some of his work for lente.net on a widget from my very toolkit.

It is very refreshing to see that what i do is actually useful for others. 

*But i also have a request:* If you find anything of what i write useful, please tweet about it or link my work in other ways, tweet me, star [my blog on github](https://github.com/NetzwergX/netzwergx.github.com) or star my [jekyll template toolkit](https://github.com/NetzwergX/jekyll-template-toolkit/). Let the world know what you like (or dislike) and where you found it. Thanks!

### WCF

Another part of what i am doing has to do with WCF. I will start selling commercial software when WCF 2.0 becomes stable. WCF 2.0 public beta (and WBB 4.0 public beta) should be out in a matter of weeks now, so things will get hot there, soon!

Additionally i got enganged with [wbbaddons.com](http://wbbaddons.com), and will give support for both my commercial as also noncommercial WCF 2.0 / WBB 4.0 packages there. I am currently writing the necessary software for wbbaddons to facilitate this. This means that wbbaddons will have the infrastructure to host packages and their support from any developer. I will post about this once there is more to share, but the general idea is to get a counterpart to the Plugin-Store of WoltLab. In the Plugin-Store you can deploy your packages and target a wide audience easily, but wbbaddons will offer the opportunity to develop packages easily, get feedback on your source code (and automated checks if your package is valid), and give support (Dev-to-User) for your plugin as well as benefit from an active User-to-User support that has evolved for many years now.
