While working on my blog, i encountered several flaws in JTT and went to fix them. There were some minor issues,
e.g. an escaping issue in the category list widget which made the site fail the validation check and a minor issue
with the pagination.

But there was also a bigger issue with the archive page, of which i am unsure why it happened in the first place, since i
tested the whole thing with fake posts from different years. Nayways, i reworked the whole archive page and it now works like
a charm and passes all validation checks.

I will continue to work on some different additions - e.g. a TapirGo! search box, and even some little extra:
Search term highlight if you found the site via one of the great search engines! Stay tuned.
