# About Me

Hello,  
and thanks for being interested in my blog! I hope you will find some interesting stuff here.

My name is [*Sebastian*](/legal/), and I am a masters student of computer science at the *Technical University of Dortmund*
and a *Research Assistant* at Chair V for Programming Systems.  
Prior to that, I have worked as a freelancer offering software development services and consultation in Java & PHP.

My research is focused on creating a left-shift and empowering domain experts to
solve their problems in an intuitive way by developing DSL and PSLs. My work
is currently focused on <i>X-as-Models</i> and <i>executable models</i>, as well as
structural operational semantics for such models, enabling full-code generation without
the need to write custom code generators (publications pending).

I like to code interesting things in my spare time, at the moment focusing on DSLs & their type systems as well as
approaches to create multi-paradigm software by leveraging functional approaches in OOP applications.

When I'm not coding, I am an avid space exploration enthusiast and probably learning something interesting about
the universe today.

I have recently begun this blog as a serious platform to get my thoughts out on some topics, mostly related to
coding, software-development, -engineering & -design as well as language design and its implications of programs.

## About the blog

This blog is authored in Markdown and the typesetting for math equations is done via locally-included MathJax.

The static site generator behing it is Jekyll, and the page is hosted on GitHub Pages (see [Privacy Policy](/legal/)).
The PDF are generated using Google Chrome and printing to PDF. Bibliography is provided by Bibtex.JS.

The usage of MathJax and Bibtex.JS means I can easily convert posts to and from LaTex, enabling easy publishing to
the web but also powerful typesetting where needed for PDFs.

The style of the site is the Jekyll Theme "Minima", with slight alterations (mostly to the footer and for printing).
