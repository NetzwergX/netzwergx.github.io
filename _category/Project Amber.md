[Project Amber] aims at bringing sealed classes and interfaces
as well as records and the assorted features such as pattern matching to Java.

Articles in this category explore the design-space of applications in a world where
Amber has been sucessfully implemented, including, but not limited to:

* pattern matching, with full deconstruction patterns, in `instanceof` & `switch`
* `let` binding with destructuring (deconstruction patterns)
* [Enhanced Enums] (available via the `enhanced-enums` branch of [Project Amber])
