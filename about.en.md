My name is Sebastian, I am mid-twenty and student of computer science at a technical university.

While learning theoretical computer science is a hell of a lot of fun, I often find myself in the
need to do some 'actual, real stuff' and just code things, be it either in Java (my beloved language),
PHP (this one is a hate-love) or Haskell (which is really great for rapid prototyping and has a **very**
expressive syntax), or be it creating & designing a new web site. Since last year, I am also a blogger.

While I have the most experience in Java (almost ten years now), the programming language I have released
most software in is PHP. This is mostly due to the fact that PHP can be easier deployed then Java, and partial
due to the fact that I had different web sites and created that software for my own needs.

Most of the time I worked with WCF 1.1 (and before that WCF 1.0), and I will continue to realease software
for WCF 2.0. Lately I have gotten more and more interested in Liquid and created the 'Jekyll Template Toolkit',
a collection of liquid templates designed for the use of vanilla jekyll, thus runnable on GitHub Pages.

I have released a number of [open source projects on Github](http://www.github.com/NetzwergX) and in the
[WoltLab Plugin-Store](http://www.woltlab.com/pluginstore/plugins.html?userID=1337633). You can also check out 
[my software portfolio](http://teumert.net/software.html) to browse some of my favorite creations.

### Contact & Hire me

If you are interested in hiring me for a WCF 2.0 plugin, a Java application or the creation of a (responsive)
web site, you can contact me via email to <sebastian.teumert@gmx.de>.
